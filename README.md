Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an open-source library that provides an efficient and effective implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm.

Shortly after its development and initial release, XGBoost became the go-to method and often the key component in winning solutions for a range of problems in machine learning competitions.

Regression predictive modeling problems involve predicting a numerical value such as a dollar amount or a height. XGBoost can be used directly for regression predictive modeling.

**Extreme Gradient Boosting**

Gradient boosting refers to a class of ensemble machine learning algorithms that can be used for classification or regression predictive modeling problems.

Ensembles are constructed from decision tree models. Trees are added one at a time to the ensemble and fit to correct the prediction errors made by prior models. This is a type of ensemble machine learning model referred to as boosting.

Models are fit using any arbitrary differentiable loss function and gradient descent optimization algorithm. This gives the technique its name, “gradient boosting,” as the loss gradient is minimized as the model is fit, much like a neural network.

Extreme Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost for short, is an efficient open-source implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. As such, XGBoost is an algorithm, an open-source project, and a Python library.

It was initially developed by Tianqi Chen and was described by Chen and Carlos Guestrin in their 2016 paper titled “XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System.”

It is designed to be both computationally efficient (e.g. fast to execute) and highly effective, perhaps more effective than other open-source implementations.

The two main reasons to use XGBoost are execution speed and model performance.

XGBoost dominates structured or tabular datasets on classification and regression predictive modeling problems. The evidence is that it is the go-to algorithm for competition winners on the Kaggle competitive data science platform.
